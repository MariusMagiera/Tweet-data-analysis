# Tweet-data-analysis-
Twitter is public by default and the messages exchanged through the network can be downloaded at scale through the application programming interface (API)  that the platform makes available to developers and, by extension, researchers. This repository contains Scripts for parsing and accessing the Tweet data and also for several measurements like time series, Entropy-like metrics, Popularity distributions and more.
